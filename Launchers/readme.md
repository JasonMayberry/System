Custom Launchers for the Desktop (or anywhere)  

Launchers for commands that I do not use enough to remember or some of the commands are to long. Setting alises or keyboard shortcuts may also be a good way to handle this.  
   
Can be copied to:  
`~/.local/share/applications` # A good place to keep all custom launchers. You can copy or softlink launchers that are used more often to the ~/Desktop. If you want them to show up in the menu append the file name with .desktop
