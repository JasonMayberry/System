How to restart X Window Server from command line?
I'd really like to be able to restart my GUI without having to do a full system reboot.
Answer:
This script will run:

sudo systemctl restart display-manager

This will restart the appropriate display manager service:
(lightdm till 17.04, gdm3 after, sddm in Kubuntu, etc.)

NOTE:
This will forcefully quit all graphical programs, 
you'll lose any unsaved work including the contents of your clipboard, 
and you'll be logged out. Non-graphical programs will not be affected.
